# Descartes
**A `python` dispatching wrapper around the [`SLiM`](https://messerlab.org/slim/) simulation program.**

This project provides a dispatching script to run a `slim` simulation file. The script is `dispatcher.py` which can serve as either the primary wrapper for which to run a simulation file or a skeleton for more complex simulations.

## Usage
The most basic usage pattern is as follows:
```bash
python dispatcher.py --rep 1 [opts]
```
